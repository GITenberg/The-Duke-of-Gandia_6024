<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p><i>The Vatican<br />Enter</i> C&AElig;SAR <i>and</i> VANNOZZA</p>
<p>C&AElig;SAR</p>
<p>Now, mother, though thou love my brother more,<br />Am I not more
thy son than he?</p>
<p>VANNOZZA</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not more.</p>
<p>C&AElig;SAR</p>
<p>Have I more Spaniard in me - less of thee?<br />Did our Most Holiest
father thrill thy womb<br />With more Italian passion than brought forth<br />Me?</p>
<p>VANNOZZA</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Child, thine elder never was as thou -<br />Spake
never thus.</p>
<p>C&AElig;SAR</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I doubt it not.&nbsp; But I,<br />Mother,
am not mine elder.&nbsp; He desires<br />And he enjoys the life God
gives him - God,<br />The Pope our father, and thy sacred self,<br />Mother
beloved and hallowed.&nbsp; I desire<br />More.</p>
<p>VANNOZZA</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou wast ever sleepless as the wind -<br />A child
anhungered for thy time to be<br />Man.&nbsp; See thy purple about thee.&nbsp;
Art thou not<br />Cardinal?</p>
<p>C&AElig;SAR</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ay; my father&rsquo;s eminence<br />Set so the
stamp on mine.&nbsp; I will not die<br />Cardinal.</p>
<p>VANNOZZA</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;C&aelig;sar, wilt thou cleave my heart?<br />Have
I not loved thee?</p>
<p>C&AElig;SAR</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ay, fair mother - ay.<br />Thou
hast loved my father likewise.&nbsp; Dost thou love<br />Giulia - the
sweet Farnese - called the Fair<br />In all the Roman streets that call
thee Rose?<br />And that bright babe Giovanni, whom our sire,<br />Thy
holy lord and hers, hath stamped at birth<br />As duke of Nepi?</p>
<p>VANNOZZA</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When thy sire begat<br />Thee,
sinful though he ever was - fierce, fell,<br />Spaniard - I fear me,
Jesus for his sins<br />Bade Satan pass into him.</p>
<p>C&AElig;SAR</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And fill thee
full,<br />Sweet sinless mother.&nbsp; Fear it not.&nbsp; Thou hast<br />Children
more loved of him and thee than me -<br />Our bright Francesco, born
to smile and sway,<br />And her whose face makes pale the sun in heaven,<br />Whose
eyes outlaugh the splendour of the sea,<br />Whose hair has all noon&rsquo;s
wonders in its weft,<br />Whose mouth is God&rsquo;s and Italy&rsquo;s
one rose,<br />Lucrezia.</p>
<p>VANNOZZA</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dost thou love them then?&nbsp; My child,<br />How
should not I then love thee?</p>
<p>C&AElig;SAR</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God alone<br />Knows.&nbsp;
Was not God - the God of love, who bade<br />His son be man because
he hated man,<br />And saw him scourged and hanging, and at last<br />Forgave
the sin wherewith he had stamped us, seeing<br />So fair a full atonement
- was not God<br />Bridesman when Christ&rsquo;s crowned vicar took
to bride<br />My mother?</p>
<p>VANNOZZA</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speak not thou to me of God.<br />I
have sinned, I have sinned - I would I had died a nun,<br />Cloistered!</p>
<p>C&AElig;SAR</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There too my sire had found thee.&nbsp; Priests<br />Make
way where warriors dare not - save when war<br />Sets wide the floodgates
of the weirs of hell.<br />And what hast thou to do with sin?&nbsp;
Hath he<br />Whose sin was thine not given thee there and then<br />God&rsquo;s
actual absolution?&nbsp; Mary lived<br />God&rsquo;s virgin, and God&rsquo;s
mother: mine art thou,<br />Who am Christlike even as thou art virginal.<br />And
if thou love me or love me not God knows,<br />And God, who made me
and my sire and thee,<br />May take the charge upon him.&nbsp; I am
I.<br />Somewhat I think to do before my day<br />Pass from me.&nbsp;
Did I love thee not at all,<br />I would not bid thee know it.</p>
<p>VANNOZZA</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alas, my son!</p>
<p>C&AElig;SAR</p>
<p>Alas, my mother, sounds no sense for men -<br />Rings but reverberate
folly, whence resounds<br />Returning laughter.&nbsp; Weep or smile
on me,<br />Thy sunshine or thy rainbow softens not<br />The mortal
earth wherein thou hast clad me.&nbsp; Nay,<br />But rather would I
see thee smile than weep,<br />Mother.&nbsp; Thou art lovelier, smiling.</p>
<p>VANNOZZA</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is this<br />Thou
hast at heart to do?&nbsp; God&rsquo;s judgment hangs<br />Above us.&nbsp;
I that girdled thee in me<br />As Mary girdled Jesus yet unborn<br />-
Thou dost believe it?&nbsp; A creedless heretic<br />Thou art not?</p>
<p>C&AElig;SAR</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I?&nbsp; God&rsquo;s vicar&rsquo;s
child?</p>
<p>VANNOZZA</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be God<br />Praised!&nbsp;
I, then, I, thy mother, bid thee, pray,<br />Pray thee but say what
hungers in thy heart,<br />And whither thou wouldst hurl the strenuous
life<br />That works within thee.</p>
<p>C&AElig;SAR</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whither?&nbsp; Am not I<br />Hinge
of the gate that opens heaven - that bids<br />God open when my sire
thrusts in the key -<br />Cardinal?&nbsp; Canst thou dream I had rather
be<br />Duke?</p>
<p><i>Enter</i> FRANCESCO</p>
<p>FRANCESCO</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wilt thou take mine office, C&aelig;sar mine?<br />I
heard thy laugh deride it.&nbsp; Mother, whence<br />Comes that sweet
gift of grace from dawn to dawn<br />That daily shows thee sweeter?</p>
<p>C&AElig;SAR</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knowest thou
none<br />Lovelier?</p>
<p>VANNOZZA</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My C&aelig;sar finds me not so fair.<br />Thou
art over fond, Francesco.</p>
<p>C&AElig;SAR</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nay, no whit.<br />Our
heavenly father on earth adores no less<br />Our mother than our sister:
and I hold<br />His heart and eye, his spirit and his sense,<br />Infallible.</p>
<p><i>Enter the</i> POPE</p>
<p>ALEXANDER</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jest not with God.&nbsp; I heard<br />A
holy word, a hallowing epithet,<br />Cardinal C&aelig;sar, trip across
thy tongue<br />Lightly.</p>
<p>C&AElig;SAR</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most holiest father, I desire<br />Paternal absolution
- when thy laugh<br />Has waned from lip and eyelid.</p>
<p>ALEXANDER</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take it now,<br />And
Christ preserve thee, C&aelig;sar, as thou art,<br />To serve him as
I serve him.&nbsp; Rose of mine,<br />My rose of roses, whence has fallen
this dew<br />That dims the sweetest eyes love ever lit<br />With light
that mocks the morning?</p>
<p>VANNOZZA</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nay, my lord,<br />I
know not - nay, I knew not if I wept.</p>
<p>ALEXANDER</p>
<p>Our sons and Christ&rsquo;s and Peter&rsquo;s whom we praise,<br />Are
they - are these - fallen out?</p>
<p>FRANCESCO</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not I with
him,<br />Nor he, I think, with me.</p>
<p>C&AElig;SAR</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forbid it, God!<br />The God
that set thee where thou art, and there<br />Sustains thee, bids the
love he kindles bind<br />Brother to brother.</p>
<p>ALEXANDER</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God or no God, man<br />Must
live and let man live - while one man&rsquo;s life<br />Galls not another&rsquo;s.&nbsp;
Fools and fiends are men<br />Who play the fiend that is not.&nbsp;
Why shouldst thou,<br />Girt with the girdle of the church, and given<br />Power
to preside on spirit and flesh - or thou,<br />Clothed with the glad
world&rsquo;s glory - priest or prince,<br />Turn on thy brother an
evil eye, or deem<br />Your father God hath dealt his doom amiss<br />Toward
either or toward any?&nbsp; Hath not Rome,<br />Hath not the Lord Christ&rsquo;s
kingdom, where his will<br />Is done on earth, enough of all that man<br />Thirsts,
hungers, lusts for - pleasure, pride, and power -<br />To sate you and
to share between you?&nbsp; Whence<br />Should she, the godless heathen&rsquo;s
goddess once,<br />Discord, heave up her hissing head again<br />Between
love&rsquo;s Christian children - love&rsquo;s?&nbsp; Hath God<br />Cut
short the thrill that glorifies the flesh,<br />Chilled the sharp rapturous
pang that burns the blood,<br />Because an hundred even as twain at
once<br />Partake it?&nbsp; Boys, my boys, be wise, and rest,<br />Whatever
fire take hold upon your flesh,<br />Whatever dream set all your life
on fire,<br />Friends.</p>
<p>C&AElig;SAR</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Friends?&nbsp; Our father on earth, thy will be
done.</p>
<p>FRANCESCO</p>
<p>Christ&rsquo;s body, C&aelig;sar! dost thou mock?</p>
<p>C&AElig;SAR</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not I.<br />Hast
thou fallen out with me, then, that thy tongue<br />Disclaims its lingering
utterance?</p>
<p>ALEXANDER</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, by nought,<br />As nought
abides to swear by, folly seen<br />So plain and heard so loud might
well nigh make<br />Wise men believe in even the devil and God.<br />What
ails you?&nbsp; Whence comes lightning in your eyes,<br />With hissing
hints of thunder on your lips?<br />Fools! and the fools I thought to
make for men<br />Gods.&nbsp; Is it love or hate divides you - turns<br />Tooth,
fang, or claw, when time provides them prey,<br />To nip, rip, rend
each other?</p>
<p>C&AElig;SAR</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hate or love,<br />Francesco?</p>
<p>FRANCESCO</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why, I hate thee not - thou knowest<br />I
hate thee not, my C&aelig;sar.</p>
<p>C&AElig;SAR</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe<br />Thou
dost not hate or love or envy me;<br />Even as I know, and knowing believe,
we all -<br />Our father, thou and I - triune in heart -<br />Hold loveliest
of all living things to love<br />This.</p>
<p><i>Enter</i> LUCREZIA</p>
<p>LUCREZIA</p>
<p>Mother!&nbsp; What do tears and thou for once<br />Together?&nbsp;
Rain in sunshine?</p>
<p>VANNOZZA</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ask thy sire,<br />Am
I not now the moon?&nbsp; Saint Anna bore<br />Saint Mary Virgin - did
not God prefer<br />The child, and thrust behind with scarce a smile<br />The
mother?</p>
<p>ALEXANDER</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thrust not out thy thorns at
heaven,<br />Rose.</p>
<p>LUCREZIA</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what ailed her?&nbsp; And she will not say.</p>
<p>C&AElig;SAR</p>
<p>Sister, I sinned - sin must be mine.&nbsp; A word<br />Fell out askance
between us, and she wept<br />Because our father chid us.</p>
<p>LUCREZIA</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How should
strife<br />Find here a tongue to hiss with?&nbsp; Are not we,<br />Brothers
and sire and sister, sealed of God<br />Lovers - made one in love?</p>
<p>ALEXANDER</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deride not
God,<br />Lucrezia.</p>
<p>LUCREZIA</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Father, dost thou fear him, then?</p>
<p>ALEXANDER</p>
<p>I say not and I know not if I fear.</p>
<p>FRANCESCO</p>
<p>Thou canst not.&nbsp; Father, were he terrible,<br />How long wouldst
thou live - thou, his mask on earth?</p>
<p>ALEXANDER</p>
<p>Boy, art thou all a child?&nbsp; What knew they more,<br />The men
that loved and feared and died for God,<br />Than I and thou who know
him not?&nbsp; We know<br />This life is ours, and sweet, if shame and
fear<br />Make us not less than man: and less were they<br />Who crawled
and writhed and cowered and called on God<br />To save them from him.&nbsp;
Here I stand as he,<br />God, or God&rsquo;s very figure wrought in
flesh,<br />More godlike than was Jesus.&nbsp; Dare I fear<br />Whipping
and hanging?&nbsp; Thou, my cardinal,<br />Canst think not to be scourged
and crucified -<br />Ha?</p>
<p>C&AElig;SAR</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nay: there lurks no God in me.&nbsp; And thou,<br />Father,
dost thou fear?</p>
<p>ALEXANDER</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I?&nbsp; Nought less than God.<br />But
if we take him lightly on our lips<br />Too light his name will sound
in all men&rsquo;s ears<br />Till earth and air, when man says God,
respond<br />Laughter.&nbsp; Forbear him.</p>
<p>C&AElig;SAR</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wisdom lives in thee,<br />And
cries not out along the streets as when<br />None of God&rsquo;s folk
that heard regarded her,<br />As all that hear thy word regard - or
die,<br />Being not outside God&rsquo;s eyeshot.&nbsp; Dost thou sleep<br />Here
in his special keeping - here - to-night,<br />Brother?</p>
<p>FRANCESCO</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What bids thee care to know?</p>
<p>C&AElig;SAR</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They say<br />These
holy streets of heaven&rsquo;s most holiest choice<br />Lie dangerous
now in darkness if a man<br />Walk not on holiest errands.&nbsp; Thou,
they say,<br />Wert scarce a Christlike sacrifice if slain.<br />Too
many dead flow down the Tiber&rsquo;s flow<br />Nightly.&nbsp; They
say it.</p>
<p>FRANCESCO</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I never called
thee yet<br />Fool.</p>
<p>C&AElig;SAR</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah, my lord and brother, didst thou now,<br />Were
this not thankless?&nbsp; God - our father&rsquo;s God -<br />Guide
thee!&nbsp; [<i>Exit</i> FRANCESCO.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He goes,
and thanks me not.&nbsp; Our sire,<br />What says the God that lives
upon thy lips<br />And withers in thy silence?</p>
<p>LUCREZIA</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vex him not,<br />C&aelig;sar.&nbsp;
Thou seest he is weary.</p>
<p>ALEXANDER</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yea.&nbsp;
Come ye<br />With me.&nbsp; Bethink thee, C&aelig;sar.&nbsp; Vex me
not.</p>
<p><i>Exeunt</i> ALEXANDER, VANNOZZA, <i>and</i> LUCREZIA.</p>
<p>C&AElig;SAR</p>
<p>Thou wilt not bid me this, I think, again,<br />Father.</p>
<p><i>Enter</i> MICHELOTTO</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou art swift of speed at need.&nbsp; I bade thee<br />Abide
my bidding.</p>
<p>MICHELOTTO</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till my lord were left<br />Alone.</p>
<p>C&AElig;SAR</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou knewest it?</p>
<p>MICHELOTTO</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where my lord may be<br />And
what beseems his thrall to know of him<br />I were not worthy, knew
I not, to know.</p>
<p>C&AElig;SAR</p>
<p>I do not ask thee where my brother sleeps.<br />And where to-morrow
sees him yet asleep -</p>
<p>MICHELOTTO</p>
<p>Ask of the fishers&rsquo; nets on Tiber.</p>
<p>C&AElig;SAR</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nay -<br />Not
I but Rome shall ask it.&nbsp; Pass in peace.<br />The benediction of
my sire be thine.&nbsp; [<i>Exeunt</i>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe thou liest not.&nbsp; Girl, the day<br />Looks
pale before thy glory.&nbsp; Brow, cheek, eye,<br />Lips, throat, and
bosom, thou dost overshine<br />All womanhood man ever worshipped.&nbsp;
Once<br />I held thy mother fairest born of all<br />That ever turned
old Rome to heaven.&nbsp; Thou hast read<br />Her golden Horace?</p>
<p>LUCREZIA</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Else were I cast out<br />From

mother&rsquo;s fairer daughter,&rsquo; dost thou deem<br />That praise
was ever merited as by thee?<br />I cannot.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What ails thy Holiness?</p>
<p>ALEXANDER</p>
<p>I am ill at ease: my heart is sick.&nbsp; Last night<br />No revel
here was held, and yet the day<br />Strikes heavier on me wearier, body
and soul,<br />Than though we had rioted out with raging mirth<br />The
lifelong length of darkness.</p>

all night long.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wast thou<br />Wakeful?&nbsp;
No trouble clung about thee?&nbsp; Nought<br />Made the air of night
heavier with presage felt<br />As joy feels fear and withers?&nbsp;

<p>GIORGIO</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Holiest sire,<br />Last night
I kept my boat on Tiber - Sire,<br />The thing I saw was nothing of
my deed -<br />It shook me out of sleep to see it - Lord,<br />Have
mercy: look not so upon me.</p>
<p>ALEXANDER</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dog,<br />Speak,
while thy tongue is thine.</p>
<p>GIORGIO</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two men came down<br />And peered
along the water-side: and two<br />Came after - men whose eyes raked
all the night,<br />Searching the shore - I lay beneath my boat -<br />Beside
it on the darkling side - and saw.<br />Then came a horseman - Sire,
his horse was white -<br />The moonshine made his mane like dull white
fire -<br />And on his crupper heavily hung a corpse,<br />Arms held
from swaying on this side, legs on that,<br />I know not which on either
- but the men<br />Held fast that held: and hard on Tiber side<br />They
swung the crupper towards the water - sharp<br />And swift as man may
steer a horse - and caught<br />And slung their dead into the stream:
and he<br />Drifted, and caught the moon across his face<br />That shone
like life against it: and the chief<br />Till then sat silent as the
moon at watch,<br />And then bade hurl stones on the drifting dead<br />And
sink him out of sight; and seeing this done,<br />Rode thence, and they
strode after.</p>
<p>ALEXANDER</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Man, and thou
-<br />Thou?</p>
<p>GIORGIO</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sire, I set my heart again to sleep:<br />I turned
and slept under my boatside.</p>
<p>ALEXANDER</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Man -<br />Dog
- devil, if this be truth, and if my fear<br />Lie not - how hadst thou
heart to hold thy peace?<br />How comes it that the warders of the shore<br />Knew
not of thee, while yet the crime was hot,<br />What crime had made night
hell?</p>
<p>GIORGIO</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A thousand times<br />I have
seen such sights, but never till this hour<br />Seen him who cared to
hear of them.</p>
<p>ALEXANDER</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till now,<br />Never.&nbsp;
He looks in God&rsquo;s mute face and mine,<br />And says it.&nbsp;
God be good to me!&nbsp; But God<br />Will not - or is not.&nbsp; Where
is then thy dead,<br />Devil, called of God from hell to smite - to
scourge -<br />Me?</p>
<p>GIORGIO</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sire, at hand I left him.</p>

thou art hale and whole.&nbsp; And now<br />Behoves thee rise again
as Christ our God,<br />Vicarious Christ, and cast as flesh away<br />This
grief from off thy godhead.&nbsp; I and thou,<br />One, will set hand
as never God hath set<br />To the empire and the steerage of the world.<br />Do
thou forget but him who is dead, and was<br />Nought, and bethink thee
what a world to wield<br />The eternal God hath given into thine hands<br />Which
daily mould him out of bread, and give<br />His kneaded flesh to feed
on.&nbsp; Thou and I<br />Will make this rent and ruinous Italy<br />One.&nbsp;
Ours it shall be, body and soul, and great<br />Above all power and
glory given of God<br />To them that died to set thee where thou art
-<br />Throned on the dust of C&aelig;sar and of Christ,<br />Imperial.&nbsp;

Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we usually do not
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,
even years after the official publication date.

Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.

Most people start at our Web sites at:
http://gutenberg.net or
http://promo.net/pg

These Web sites include award-winning information about Project
Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our new
eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).


Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.

http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext04 or
ftp://ftp.ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext04

Or /etext03, 02, 01, 00, 99, 98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90

Just search by the first five letters of the filename you want,
as it appears in our Newsletters.


Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.

Here is the briefest record of our progress (* means estimated):

disclaims most of our liability to you. It also tells you how
you may distribute copies of this eBook if you want to.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM EBOOKS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBooks,
is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor Michael S. Hart
through the Project Gutenberg Association (the "Project").

below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this eBook
under the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

Please do not use the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark to market

To create these eBooks, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works. Despite these efforts, the Project's eBooks and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects". Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other eBook medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

If you discover a Defect in this eBook within 90 days of
receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
time to the person you received it from. If you received it

copy. If you received it electronically, such person may
choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to
