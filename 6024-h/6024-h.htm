<p class="poetry">Have I more Spaniard in me&mdash;less of

Spake never thus.</p>

<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I doubt it
not.&nbsp; But I,<br />
Mother, am not mine elder.&nbsp; He desires<br />
And he enjoys the life God gives him&mdash;God,<br />
The Pope our father, and thy sacred self,<br />
Mother beloved and hallowed.&nbsp; I desire<br />
More.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">VANNOZZA</span></p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou wast ever sleepless as
the wind&mdash;<br />
A child anhungered for thy time to be<br />
Man.&nbsp; See thy purple about thee.&nbsp; Art thou not<br />
Cardinal?</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">C&AElig;SAR</span></p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ay; my father&rsquo;s
eminence<br />
Set so the stamp on mine.&nbsp; I will not die<br />
Cardinal.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">VANNOZZA</span></p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;C&aelig;sar, wilt thou cleave
my heart?<br />
Have I not loved thee?</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">C&AElig;SAR</span></p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ay, fair
mother&mdash;ay.<br />
Thou hast loved my father likewise.&nbsp; Dost thou love<br />
Giulia&mdash;the sweet Farnese&mdash;called the Fair<br />
In all the Roman streets that call thee Rose?<br />
And that bright babe Giovanni, whom our sire,<br />
Thy holy lord and hers, hath stamped at birth<br />
As duke of Nepi?</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">VANNOZZA</span></p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When thy
sire begat<br />
Thee, sinful though he ever was&mdash;fierce, fell,<br />
Spaniard&mdash;I fear me, Jesus for his sins<br />
Bade Satan pass into him.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">C&AElig;SAR</span></p>
<p
class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And
fill thee full,<br />
Sweet sinless mother.&nbsp; Fear it not.&nbsp; Thou hast<br />
Children more loved of him and thee than me&mdash;<br />
Our bright Francesco, born to smile and sway,<br />
And her whose face makes pale the sun in heaven,<br />
Whose eyes outlaugh the splendour of the sea,<br />
Whose hair has all noon&rsquo;s wonders in its weft,<br />
Whose mouth is God&rsquo;s and Italy&rsquo;s one rose,<br />
Lucrezia.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">VANNOZZA</span></p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dost thou love them
then?&nbsp; My child,<br />
How should not I then love thee?</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">C&AElig;SAR</span></p>
<p
class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God
alone<br />
Knows.&nbsp; Was not God&mdash;the God of love, who bade<br />
His son be man because he hated man,<br />
And saw him scourged and hanging, and at last<br />
Forgave the sin wherewith he had stamped us, seeing<br />
So fair a full atonement&mdash;was not God<br />
Bridesman when Christ&rsquo;s crowned vicar took to bride<br />
My mother?</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">VANNOZZA</span></p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speak not
thou to me of God.<br />
I have sinned, I have sinned&mdash;I would I had died a nun,<br
/>
Cloistered!</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">C&AElig;SAR</span></p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There too my sire had found
thee.&nbsp; Priests<br />
Make way where warriors dare not&mdash;save when war<br />
Sets wide the floodgates of the weirs of hell.<br />
And what hast thou to do with sin?&nbsp; Hath he<br />
Whose sin was thine not given thee there and then<br />
God&rsquo;s actual absolution?&nbsp; Mary lived<br />
God&rsquo;s virgin, and God&rsquo;s mother: mine art thou,<br />
Who am Christlike even as thou art virginal.<br />
And if thou love me or love me not God knows,<br />
And God, who made me and my sire and thee,<br />
May take the charge upon him.&nbsp; I am I.<br />
Somewhat I think to do before my day<br />
Pass from me.&nbsp; Did I love thee not at all,<br />
I would not bid thee know it.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">VANNOZZA</span></p>
<p
class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alas,
my son!</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">C&AElig;SAR</span></p>
<p class="poetry">Alas, my mother, sounds no sense for
men&mdash;<br />
Rings but reverberate folly, whence resounds<br />
Returning laughter.&nbsp; Weep or smile on me,<br />
Thy sunshine or thy rainbow softens not<br />
The mortal earth wherein thou hast clad me.&nbsp; Nay,<br />
But rather would I see thee smile than weep,<br />
Mother.&nbsp; Thou art lovelier, smiling.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">VANNOZZA</span></p>
<p
class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What
is this<br />
Thou hast at heart to do?&nbsp; God&rsquo;s judgment hangs<br />
Above us.&nbsp; I that girdled thee in me<br />
As Mary girdled Jesus yet unborn<br />
&mdash;Thou dost believe it?&nbsp; A creedless heretic<br />
Thou art not?</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">C&AElig;SAR</span></p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I?&nbsp;
God&rsquo;s vicar&rsquo;s child?</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">VANNOZZA</span></p>
<p
class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be
God<br />
Praised!&nbsp; I, then, I, thy mother, bid thee, pray,<br />
Pray thee but say what hungers in thy heart,<br />
And whither thou wouldst hurl the strenuous life<br />
That works within thee.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">C&AElig;SAR</span></p>
<p
class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whither?&nbsp;
Am not I<br />
Hinge of the gate that opens heaven&mdash;that bids<br />
God open when my sire thrusts in the key&mdash;<br />
Cardinal?&nbsp; Canst thou dream I had rather be<br />
Duke?</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>Enter</i> <span

<p style="text-align: center"><span

C&aelig;sar mine?<br />
I heard thy laugh deride it.&nbsp; Mother, whence<br />
Comes that sweet gift of grace from dawn to dawn<br />
That daily shows thee sweeter?</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">C&AElig;SAR</span></p>
<p

thou none<br />
Lovelier?</p>

<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My C&aelig;sar finds me not
so fair.<br />
Thou art over fond, Francesco.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">C&AElig;SAR</span></p>
<p
class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nay,
no whit.<br />
Our heavenly father on earth adores no less<br />
Our mother than our sister: and I hold<br />
His heart and eye, his spirit and his sense,<br />
Infallible.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Enter the <span

<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">ALEXANDER</span></p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jest not
with God.&nbsp; I heard<br />
A holy word, a hallowing epithet,<br />
Cardinal C&aelig;sar, trip across thy tongue<br />
Lightly.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">C&AElig;SAR</span></p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most holiest father, I
desire<br />
Paternal absolution&mdash;when thy laugh<br />
Has waned from lip and eyelid.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span

<p
class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take
it now,<br />
And Christ preserve thee, C&aelig;sar, as thou art,<br />
To serve him as I serve him.&nbsp; Rose of mine,<br />
My rose of roses, whence has fallen this dew<br />
That dims the sweetest eyes love ever lit<br />
With light that mocks the morning?</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">VANNOZZA</span></p>
<p
class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nay,

Must live and let man live&mdash;while one man&rsquo;s life<br />
Galls not another&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Fools and fiends are men<br />
Who play the fiend that is not.&nbsp; Why shouldst thou,<br />
Girt with the girdle of the church, and given<br />
Power to preside on spirit and flesh&mdash;or thou,<br />
Clothed with the glad world&rsquo;s glory&mdash;priest or
prince,<br />
Turn on thy brother an evil eye, or deem<br />
Your father God hath dealt his doom amiss<br />
Toward either or toward any?&nbsp; Hath not Rome,<br />
Hath not the Lord Christ&rsquo;s kingdom, where his will<br />
Is done on earth, enough of all that man<br />
Thirsts, hungers, lusts for&mdash;pleasure, pride, and
power&mdash;<br />
To sate you and to share between you?&nbsp; Whence<br />
Should she, the godless heathen&rsquo;s goddess once,<br />
Discord, heave up her hissing head again<br />
Between love&rsquo;s Christian children&mdash;love&rsquo;s?&nbsp;
Hath God<br />
Cut short the thrill that glorifies the flesh,<br />
Chilled the sharp rapturous pang that burns the blood,<br />
Because an hundred even as twain at once<br />
Partake it?&nbsp; Boys, my boys, be wise, and rest,<br />

Whatever dream set all your life on fire,<br />

nought,<br />

Wise men believe in even the devil and God.<br />
What ails you?&nbsp; Whence comes lightning in your eyes,<br />
With hissing hints of thunder on your lips?<br />
Fools! and the fools I thought to make for men<br />
Gods.&nbsp; Is it love or hate divides you&mdash;turns<br />
Tooth, fang, or claw, when time provides them prey,<br />
To nip, rip, rend each other?</p>

Behoves thee rise again as Christ our God,<br />
Vicarious Christ, and cast as flesh away<br />
This grief from off thy godhead.&nbsp; I and thou,<br />
One, will set hand as never God hath set<br />
To the empire and the steerage of the world.<br />
Do thou forget but him who is dead, and was<br />
Nought, and bethink thee what a world to wield<br />
The eternal God hath given into thine hands<br />
Which daily mould him out of bread, and give<br />
His kneaded flesh to feed on.&nbsp; Thou and I<br />
Will make this rent and ruinous Italy<br />
One.&nbsp; Ours it shall be, body and soul, and great<br />
Above all power and glory given of God<br />
To them that died to set thee where thou art&mdash;<br />
Throned on the dust of C&aelig;sar and of Christ,<br />
Imperial.&nbsp; Earth shall quail again, and rise<br />
Again the higher because she trembled.&nbsp; Rome<br />
So bade it be: it was, and shall be.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm

and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy

If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See

works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

copied or distributed:

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
